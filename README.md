# Abstract
Co-stimulatory signals are essential for full activation of na¨ıve CD8+ T cells. Where recent studies focus on single molecular layers, the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data provides a
more complete view of the underlying processes. The aim of this study is to investigate how na¨ıve CD8+ T cells respond to differential co-stimulation using integrated transcriptomic and proteomic
data. To this end, RNA-seq and TMT-based proteomics were used to analyze human CD8+ T cells under different co-stimulated conditions (CD27, CD28, CD137 and combinations). CD28+CD137 stimulation, gave the strongest molecular response, reflected in high numbers of differentially expressed genes and proteins. Pathway analysis revealed that co-stimulation triggered activation of cell cycle progression, glycolysis, and other metabolic pathways. Integrated analysis showed both overlap and discordance between mRNA and protein levels, indicating the presence of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis supported these findings. We aimed to include ATAC-seq and predictive modeling for biomarker discovery, but due to data quality limitations, further analyzing did not succeed. These findings provide a molecular framework for understanding T cell activation and may contribute to the design of immunotherapeutic strategies.
